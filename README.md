Cloud deployments

- There are two ways to deploy web applications:
  1. As a web service without using containerized applications such as docker and;
  2. As containerized applications (In cases where the primary runtime language is not supported natively on the platform, such as PHP and render)

## Docker
- Understanding basic docker functionality: https://docker-curriculum.com/; code found on original repo; https://github.com/prakhar1989/docker-curriculum or my fork; https://github.com/OCHIENGHerman/docker-curriculum
- Practical using node js (has little overhead and easy to understand- then migrate to your preferred language); https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-node-js-application-with-docker (deploy to cloud service of choice)
